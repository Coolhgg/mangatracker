Phase 1 MVP: MangaDex + Supabase + Worker\n\nSummary\n- Introduce Turborepo with apps/web (Next.js 14) and apps/worker (BullMQ) plus packages/db (Prisma).\n- Implement Supabase Auth (magic link + GitHub) and protect app routes.\n- Add Series by URL/search; upsert Series; associate to user; enqueue sync.\n- Series detail with chapters; mark read/unread; manual sync.\n- Worker syncs MangaDex series/chapters with rate limiting and repeatable jobs.\n- CI with Node 20, Postgres/Redis services, prisma generate/migrate (create-only), turbo typecheck/lint/test/build.\n- Local dev via docker-compose; deployment docs for Vercel/Render/Supabase.\n\nWhy\nDeliver a minimal but complete end-to-end tracker so we can iterate on UX and performance while ensuring infra and CI are sound.
